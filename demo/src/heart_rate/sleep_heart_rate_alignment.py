"""

The error variance of the parameters is higher during awake time compared with sleep time. During sleep time, the HR, AVNN, and pNN50 have relatively low error rates, RMSSD, SDNN, LF, and HF have moderate error rates, and LF/HF ratio has a high error rate. However, during awake time, AVNN has a moderate error rate, and HR and other HRV parameters have high error rates.
