# using the oscillatory theorem, a combination of the actigram data and heart rate should instead, in our case, lead to more accurate readings instead of them being motion artefacts


"""
Accelerometers and gyroscopes may provide additional motion information to interpret heart rate changes in context of various activities. Accelerometers primarily detect changes in linear motion in 3 axes whereas gyroscopes primarily measure angular motion. This additional input is helpful in athletic applications. In addition to motion detection, these can be used as primary sensors: data from these sensors can be fed into devices using ballistocardiogram (BCG)-based heart rate detection. BCG analyzes the repetitive motion of the human body arising from the sudden ejection of blood into the great vessels with each heartbeat [40]. The accuracy of acceleration-based sensors is affected by the site of placement on human body [41]. Integration with barometers and global positioning system (GPS) may improve the accurate assessment of activity-related HR/HRV changesâ€”these technologies are readily available in consumer devices such as smartphones, however, this approach has not been validated ye
