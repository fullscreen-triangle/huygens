Time domain measures included mean heart rate, the standard deviation of normal-to-normal (NN) intervals (SDNN), the standard deviation of the averages of NN-intervals in all 5 min segments (SDANN), HRV triangular index (HRVi), and the square mean root of the sum of squares of adjacent NN interval differences (rMSSD). Frequency-domain measures included the powers in the very low frequency (VLF; 0.0033–0.04 Hz), low frequency (LF; 0.04–0.15 Hz), and high frequency (HF; 0.15–0.4 Hz) ranges. In addition, the HRV power contents in arbitrary overlapping segments of 0.01 Hz width were calculated from 0.01 to 0.4 Hz to assess association between targeted frequency and respective concordance.

Non-linear HRV metrics included detrended fluctuation analysis (DF-α1 and DF-α2) and Poincaré plots with calculated longitudinal and transversal standard deviation (SD1 and SD2).9,11
