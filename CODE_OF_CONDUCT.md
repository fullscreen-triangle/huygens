## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders and maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, including:

* GitHub repositories and issue trackers
* Documentation and wikis  
* Email communications related to the project
* Scientific conferences and presentations related to the work
* Online and offline research collaboration spaces
* Social media accounts associated with the project

This Code of Conduct also applies when an individual is officially representing the project in public spaces.

## Scientific Integrity Standards

As a scientific research project, we maintain additional standards for:

### Data and Code Integrity
* All data analysis must be reproducible with provided code
* Statistical methods must be appropriate and properly applied
* Results must be presented honestly without selective reporting
* Code must be properly tested and validated

### Collaboration Ethics
* Credit collaborators and contributors appropriately
* Share negative results as well as positive findings
* Respect confidentiality of unpublished research
* Follow institutional review board guidelines for human subjects research

### Open Science Practices
* Make research findings openly accessible when possible
* Provide clear documentation for all methods and analyses
* Share code and data following FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable)
* Engage constructively with peer review and scientific criticism

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at [kundai.sachikonye@wzw.tum.de](mailto:kundai.sachikonye@wzw.tum.de).

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community.

## Scientific Misconduct

Scientific misconduct including plagiarism, data fabrication, or falsification will result in immediate permanent ban from the project and may be reported to relevant institutions and journals.
