# Experimental Biometric Data Repository

**⚠️ PRIVATE DATA - NOT INCLUDED IN GIT ⚠️**

This directory contains personal biometric data for validation of the Universal Biological Oscillatory Framework and Consciousness Theories.

## Data Categories

### 🫀 **Physiological Data**
- **Heart Rate Data**: Continuous HR monitoring, including 400m sprint sessions
- **Sleep Architecture**: Sleep stages, REM/NREM cycles, sleep quality metrics
- **Activity Levels**: Daily activity patterns, exercise sessions, movement data

### 📍 **Environmental Data**
- **Geolocation Data**: Movement patterns, environmental context
- **Temporal Patterns**: Circadian rhythm analysis, temporal behavior

### 🧠 **Derived Metrics**
- **Calculated Parameters**: Heart rate variability, sleep efficiency, activity correlations
- **Pattern Analysis**: Oscillatory patterns, frequency domain analysis
- **Cross-correlations**: Multi-parameter relationships
